# üèÜ CVEXTopia AI Grinder üèÜ  
Grind Your Way to the Top with Custom AI Trading Features  

## **Project Summary**  
The **CVEXTopia AI Grinder** is an AI-powered trading application designed to enhance trading on the **CVEX platform**. Built as a **Streamlit web app**, it provides a visually intuitive and feature-rich interface, diverging from the common Telegram bot approach adopted by many other participants.  

### **Why Streamlit Instead of a TG Bot?**  
When the hackathon was announced, I aimed to build something distinct that offers a professional trading experience while keeping the process enjoyable and straightforward. Streamlit enabled me to create a **dedicated web app** that blends usability with advanced trading strategies.

## **Features**  
- **Manual Trade Execution:**  
  - Place orders (Buy Long, Open Short) with customizable parameters (Order Type, Quantity, Limit Price, Time In Force, Reduce Only).  
  - Cancel all active orders at once.  
  - Real-time equity display for tracking your grinding progress.  

- **Position Management:**  
  - View open positions with detailed metrics (Entry Price, Leverage, Unrealized P/L, etc.).  
  - Planned: Add a **Close Position** feature with a safety mechanism (e.g., price divergence smaller than X%) to minimize risks.  

- **AI Strategy Integration:**  
  - Market analysis using GPT-based predictions with confidence scores.  
  - Planned: Add more trading strategies and an **Auto Mode**, where trades are executed automatically if confidence exceeds 80% (with a sleep timer for hourly checks).  

- **User-Friendly UI:**  
  - Fun, gamified design to make trading enjoyable.  
  - Tooltips for each input field for better usability.  
  - Interactive tabs for Manual Trades, Position Info, and AI Strategies.

     - Use these insights to make informed trading decisions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes  
Due to the current CVEX API limitation (no available credits), some manual order functions and additional features couldn't be fully tested. Despite this, the app structure and core functionalities are ready for integration once the API issue is resolved.

### Current Limitations:  
- **Manual Trading:** Can view positions but lacks some order management due to API credit exhaustion.  
- **Position Closing:** Planned to add but needed a reliable liquidity check before implementation.  
- **AI Automation:** The foundation is ready, but I wanted to ensure high confidence (80%+) for auto-trades, hence the planned hourly check loop.  

## üåü Future Plans  
### Mass Adoption & Error Prevention:  
- Make the bot more robust by preventing error-prone situations and ensuring users understand each trading step.  
- Implement real-time market checks to avoid trading during low liquidity or high volatility periods.  

### Safety First Approach:  
- Develop automated position closing with a price divergence safety check to minimize losses during volatile markets.  

### Enhanced AI Integration:  
- Add more AI trading strategies with tailored risk management.  
- Implement an Auto Grind Mode that continuously monitors the market and executes trades when conditions are favorable.  

### User Feedback:  
- After the Hackathon, I plan to collect feedback from users to improve UI and functionality.  
- Regular updates to adapt to changing market conditions and user preferences.
